# Voice-Assisstance
This project is a web-based voice assistant developed with Flask and pyttsx3 for speech synthesis. It can tell the current time, provide today's date, and perform web searches. Users interact with the assistant via voice commands through a web interface, receiving responses in text or through actions like web searches.
